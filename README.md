# customer-segmentation-rfm
This project uses RFM analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By calculating RFM scores and applying clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means), it identifies distinct customer segments such as loyal, at-risk, and high-value customers. The goal is to support targeted marketing and personalized customer strategies.
